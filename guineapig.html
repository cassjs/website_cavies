            <h1>The Guinea Pig</h1>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The guinea pig or domestic guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), also known as cavy or domestic 
                cavy, is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia. Despite 
                their common name, guinea pigs are not native to Guinea, nor are they closely biologically 
                related to pigs, and the origin of the name is still unclear. They originated in the Andes 
                of South America. Studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are 
                domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy, such as C. tschudii, and do
                not exist naturally in the wild.They were originally domesticated as livestock, for
                a source of meat, and continue to be consumed as food.</p>

            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <!-- Info from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig -->
            <p>Guinea pigs are large for rodents; the common pet breeds weigh between 700 and 1,200 g (1.5 and 2.6 lb) 
                when full grown and measure between 20 and 25 cm (8 and 10 in) in length. Some livestock breeds weigh 3
                kilograms (6.6 lb) when full grown. Pet breeds live an average of four to five years, but may live 
                as long as eight.According to the 2006 Guinness World Records, the longest living guinea pig survived
                14 years, 10.5 months. Most guinea pigs have fur, but one laboratory breed adopted by some pet owners, 
                the skinny pig, is a mostly furless breed. Some breeds are longfur breeds such as the Peruvian, the Silkie, 
                and the Texel.

                    <h2>Diet</h2>
                    <p>Guinea pigs benefit from a diet of fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in addition to food pellets which are
                        often based on timothy hay. Alfalfa hay is also a popular food choice and most guinea pigs will eat large amounts
                        of alfalfa when offered it, though some controversy exists over offering alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. 
                        Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed 
                        in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones from the excess calcium in all animals except for 
                        pregnant and very young guinea pigs.</p>
