# Cavies Website
**Created By:** Jessica Cassidy

This was a final project for my Intermediate CSS and Preprocessor course at community college. 
The objective of the final was to create a mobile-first responsive website using CSS and LESS for styling. The goal was to pick 3 animals of 
our choice while utilzing Wikipedia information on those animals.
