            <h1>The Capybara</h1>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to South America. It 
                is the largest living rodent in the world. Also called capivara (in Brazil), chigüire, 
                chigüiro, or fercho (in Colombia and Venezuela), carpincho (in Argentina, Paraguay and 
                Uruguay) and ronsoco (in Peru), it is a member of the genus Hydrochoerus, of which the only
                other extant member is the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close relatives 
                include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the 
                chinchilla, and the coypu. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests and lives near 
                bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 
                individuals, but usually lives in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is not a 
                threatened species, but it is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its 
                thick fatty skin.</p><br>

            <h2>Ecology</h2>
            <p>Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals found throughout almost all countries of South America except 
                Chile. They live in densely forested areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps,
                ponds, and marshes, as well as flooded savannah and along rivers in the tropical rainforest. 
                They are superb swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes at a time. 
                Capybara have flourished in cattle ranches. They roam in home ranges averaging 10 hectares (25 acres)
                in high-density populations.

        <section id="diet">
            <h2>Diet & Prey</h2>
            <p>Capybaras are herbivores, grazing mainly on grasses and aquatic plants, as well as fruit and tree 
                bark. They are very selective feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other 
                species surrounding it. They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants 
                are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant 
                reeds during the dry season. Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional
                value in the winter, so they are not consumed at that time. The capybara's jaw hinge is not 
                perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side. Capybaras are 
                autocoprophagous, meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest 
                the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and 
                vitamins from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing 
                by cattle. As is the case with other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate 
                for the constant wear from eating grasses; their cheek teeth also grow continuously.
                <br><br>
                Like its relative the guinea pig, the capybara does not have the capacity to synthesize vitamin C, and 
                capybaras not supplemented with vitamin C in captivity have been reported to develop gum disease as a 
                sign of scurvy. They can have a lifespan of 8–10 years, but live less than four years in the wild due to 
                predation from jaguars, pumas, ocelots, eagles, and caimans. The capybara is also the preferred prey 
                of the green anaconda.</p>
